[MNUG](http://www.mnug.de) is a user group of server-side JavaScript users (amateurs, journeymen and hackers). We meet every 2nd month to discuss topics on NodeJS, server-side JavaScript and related technologies like MongoDB and CouchDB. Meetings take place (almost) on every even month on different locations. We established in October 2011 in Munich.
