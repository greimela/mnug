# Meetup: December 20, 2018

On 20th of December we would like to invite you to our next community meetup of the Munich Node.JS User Group. 
Please sign up on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Munich-Node-js-User-Group/events/255836190/) to give us a hint how many nodehackers are coming!

### What?

On 20th of December we have the following schedule:


*   **18:30: Doors open**  

    [Please note we have a new location in the Arabellastrasse 4a, next to the BayWa-Tower](https://www.tngtech.com/kontakt-und-impressum.html)
    
*   **18:45: Beer and Pizza**  
    sponsored by [TNG](https://www.tngtech.com/en.html)

*   **19:30: Introduction to N-API**  
    by [Philipp Renoth](/speakers.html#philippr)

    With Node.js v10 N-API went out of experimental phase and we're now able to
    create and provide C/C++ native userland implementation in a better way than
    NaN (Native abstractions for Node) or Node.js runtime patching.  This talk
    should give you a small overview of what has changed and what is possible now
    with N-API. [Video](https://youtu.be/_nUBCKaBjMQ)

*   **20:30: Artificial Intelligence in JavaScript using Tensorflow.js**  
    by [Mathias Burger](/speakers.html#mathiasbu)

    Tensorflow.js can be used to develop machine learning models that run on
    nodejs or in the browser. Existing models can also be reused or retrained.
    Using WebGL, the framework provides vendor independent support for hardware
    acceleration and can even outperform CPU-bound training.  In an example I will
    demonstrate how to use the low-level APIs and how to build a gesture classifier
    gathering training data from the webcam. [Video](https://youtu.be/aI7m5dvS0uo)
