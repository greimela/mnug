# Meetup: November 30, 2017

On 30th of November 2017 we would like to invite you to our next community meetup of the Munich Node.JS User Group. 
Please sign up on Meetup to give us a hint how many nodehackers are coming!

### What?

On 30th of November we have the following schedule:


*   **18:30: Door open**  
    at [Interhyp Gruppe](https://www.interhyp-gruppe.de/)
    
*   **18:45: Beer & Pizza**  
    sponsored by [Interhyp Gruppe](https://www.interhyp-gruppe.de/)
    
*   **19:30: Stronger together – using domain-driven design (DDD) and wolkenkit**  
    by [Golo Roden](/speakers.html#golor)
  
    For the development of complex software an interdisciplinary team is
    required. Unfortunately, we have never learned to communicate across
    disciplines. This makes it difficult for domain experts, developers and
    designers to understand each other – which is ultimately reflected in the
    software that solves the wrong problem, arrives on the market too late and
    whose quality is not right. Domain-driven design (DDD) focuses on the
    development of a common language and promises to improve interdisciplinary
    communication. But how does DDD work? Golo Roden introduces you to the concept
    and shows how to implement the result in JavaScript using wolkenkit, an
    open-source framework that complements DDD perfectly.

*   **20:30: TypeScript In Depth**  
    by [Michael H&auml;uslmann](/speakers.html#michaelh) and [David Dasenbrook](/speakers.html#davidd)
  
    We all love JavaScript. It is hip, dynamic, and fun. But when your
    codebase grows and your product passes past the stage of a mere
    prototype, you quickly realise that not all is well in paradise. Enter
    TypeScript, a mature solution for type-safe JavaScript that has recently
    made a couple of leaps ahead and incorporated some of the selling points
    of the new kid on the block, its main competitor, Flow. We compare
    TypeScript's and Flow's type systems, review some of the newer features
    of TypeScript, and show how you can easily integrate TypeScript into
    existing code bases.
