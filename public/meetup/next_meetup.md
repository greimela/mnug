# Meetup: June 22, 2017

On June 22, 2017 we would like to invite you to our next community meetup of
the Munich Node.JS User Group.  Please sign up on
[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Munich-Node-js-User-Group/events/240502989/) to give us a hint how many nodehackers are coming!

**Attention! We meet at the office of [Microsoft Munich](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/aktionen/smart-workspace-in-muenchen-schwabing/default.aspx)**

### What?

On June 22, 2017 we have the following schedule:

*   **18:15: Door open**  
  
*   **18:30: Start with Beer & Food**  
    sponsored by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/aktionen/smart-workspace-in-muenchen-schwabing/default.aspx)

*   **19:15: Node.js, Kubernetes, Cloud: All the Buzzwords Coming Together with Microsoft Azure!**  
    by [Patriek van Dorp](/speakers.html#patriekd)
  
    Your Node.js applications will probably be part of a bigger solution,
    having a database, a reverse proxy, some queuing technology, etc. You need a
    way to deploy and maintain your entire solution in a flexible and robust way.
    This session will be all about how you can leverage Microsoft Azure Container
    Service to provision a production ready Kubernetes cluster and how you can
    leverage Visual Studio Code to deploy and manage your applications on it.

*   **20:15: Outbreak: index-sw-9a4c43b4b4778e7d1ca619eaaf5ac1db.js**  
    by [Alexander Pope](/speakers.html#alexanderp)

    August 30, 2016, was by all accounts an average Tuesday, and release number
    523 just a simple re-factor, but something went horribly wrong that day: bad
    code escaped from the office, and it quickly spread to infect tens of
    thousands, giving rise to a hoard of zombie ServiceWorkers! This is a disaster
    about a typo. This is a thriller about technology out of control. This is a
    tragedy about wasted CPU cycles. This is a cautionary tale about living in the
    age of ServiceWorker.
  
*   **21:00: Building future-proof npm libraries with rollup.js**  
    by [Lukas Taegert](/speakers.html#lukast)

    With node.js servers today, transpiling  and bundling JavaScipt is usually
    entirely optional and will in most cases probably hurt more than help. When
    writing--possibly isomorphic--libraries to be published on npm,
    however, things look very different. Now you may have users who really care
    about bundle size or who need to be able to use your library on legacy systems.
    
    Not only will we look at how a tool like rollup enables us to use ES6 modules
    in our libraries today and make them more efficient at the same time, but also
    in what ways others will benefit from us doing so. And how we can automate
    the process of building libraries that make everyone happy :)

*   **21:45: Close down of MNUG meetup**
