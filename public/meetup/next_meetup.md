# Meetup: November 30, 2017

On 30th of November 2017 we would like to invite you to our next community meetup of the Munich Node.JS User Group. 
Please sign up on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Munich-Node-js-User-Group/events/245306047/) to give us a hint how many nodehackers are coming!

### What?

On 30th of November we have the following schedule:

*   **18:30: Door open**  
    at [Interhyp Gruppe](https://www.interhyp-gruppe.de/)
    
*   **18:45: Beer & Pizza**  
    sponsored by [Interhyp Gruppe](https://www.interhyp-gruppe.de/)
    

*   **19:33: TypeScript In Depth**  
    by [Michael H&auml;uslmann](/speakers.html#michaelh) and [David Dasenbrook](/speakers.html#davidd)
  
    We all love JavaScript. It is hip, dynamic, and fun. But when your
    codebase grows and your product passes past the stage of a mere
    prototype, you quickly realise that not all is well in paradise. Enter
    TypeScript, a mature solution for type-safe JavaScript that has recently
    made a couple of leaps ahead and incorporated some of the selling points
    of the new kid on the block, its main competitor, Flow. We compare
    TypeScript's and Flow's type systems, review some of the newer features
    of TypeScript, and show how you can easily integrate TypeScript into
    existing code bases.

*   **20:30: JavaScript - Roadtrip**  
    by [Michael Jaser](/speakers.html#michaelj)
  
    TBD

*   **20:50: Refactor Architecture**  
    by [Michael H&auml;uslmann](/speakers.html#michaelh)
  
    TBD
  
*   **22:00: Door closing**  
    by all node hackers
