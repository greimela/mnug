On 23rd of April 2018 we would like to invite you to our next community meetup of the Munich Node.JS User Group. 
Please sign up on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Munich-Node-js-User-Group/events/249663471/) to give us a hint how many nodehackers are coming!

### What?

On 23rd of April we have the following schedule:

*   **18:30: Door open**  
    at [Retail Hub](http://www.retailtechhub.com/)
    
*   **18:45: Beer & Pizza**  
    sponsored by [Retail Hub](http://www.retailtechhub.com/)
    

*   **19:30: Realtime APIs with Feathers**  
    by [Max Gerer](/speakers.html#maxg)
 
    At its core, [Feathers](https://feathersjs.com/) is a set of tools and an
    architecture pattern that make it easy to create scalable REST APIs and
    real-time applications. With Feathers, you can literally build prototypes in
    minutes and production-ready apps in days.

*   **20:30: Reactive Programming with rxjs**  
    by [Ingo Bürk](/speakers.html#ingob)
  
    [rxjs](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/) is the JavaScript implementation of the
    ReactiveX library which became more popular and important due to its extensive
    application in Angular. But what are observables, how do they work and what
    problems can we solve with them?
  
*   **22:00: Door closing**  
    by all node hackers
