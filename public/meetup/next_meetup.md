    by [Benedikt Meurer](/speakers.html#benediktm)

    The V8 team has been working on a new code generation architecture - named
    TurboFan - for more than three years, and it’s supposed to launch fully in
    Chrome M59. TurboFan replaces the previous optimizing compiler Crankshaft, but
    also adds portable, high-performance code generation abilities to V8 that
    enabled several other new key technologies, like the Ignition interpreter, and
    most of the ES2015+ optimization work.
