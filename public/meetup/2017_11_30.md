### What?

On 30th of November we have the following schedule:

    at [Interhyp Gruppe](https://www.interhyp-gruppe.de/)

*   **19:33: TypeScript In Depth**  
    by [Michael H&auml;uslmann](/speakers.html#michaelh) and [David Dasenbrook](/speakers.html#davidd)
  
    We all love JavaScript. It is hip, dynamic, and fun. But when your
    codebase grows and your product passes past the stage of a mere
    prototype, you quickly realise that not all is well in paradise. Enter
    TypeScript, a mature solution for type-safe JavaScript that has recently
    made a couple of leaps ahead and incorporated some of the selling points
    of the new kid on the block, its main competitor, Flow. We compare
    TypeScript's and Flow's type systems, review some of the newer features
    of TypeScript, and show how you can easily integrate TypeScript into
    existing code bases. [Video](https://youtu.be/OZHgxFjP0eE)

*   **20:30: JavaScript - Roadtrip**  
    by [Michael Jaser](/speakers.html#michaelj)
  
    JavaScript left your browser to rule your car. It's possible to build an
    in-car infotainment system using open web technology. This talk is about our
    experience with building such a system for the Munich based electric car
    startup Sono Motors. It covers all your favourite topics like DDD (Deadline
    Driven Development) and the ancient CAN protocol. Your first step towards your
    autonomous car running JavaScript!


*   **20:50: Refactor Architecture**  
    by [Michael H&auml;uslmann](/speakers.html#michaelh)
