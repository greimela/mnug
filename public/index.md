![Gruppenfoto](/downloads/20111201_participants.png)

MNUG is a user group of server-side JavaScript users (amateurs, journeymen and hackers). 
We meet every 2nd month to discuss topics on NodeJS, server-side JavaScript and related technologies like MongoDB and CouchDB. 
Meetings take place (almost) on every even month on different locations. 
We established in October 2011 in Munich.

## Our aims and objectives

*   to help Munich server-side JavaScript programmers to obtain broader knowledge of Node.JS, event-driven programming,
    document-oriented databases and JavaScript in general
*   to help Node.JS developers, users and people interested in the event-driven programming to come together for networking
*   to organize meetups, trainings, conferences and activities that contribute in strengthening the better understanding 
    of programming JavaScript, Node.JS and document-oriented databases.
